    <td>We began by going onto our computers and going to our sheets. We started looking at each others sheets and getting ours up to scratch I helped a lot of people and just made mine look better and allowing you to change to Caesar Cypher easily. This lesson was just checking for any mistakes so there weren't really any strategies.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was only that for most of the lesson I was doing nothing and just helping other people do the code that I did. I donâ€™t think that I have any habits to work on from this lesson.</td>

    <td>I will search on the internet how to make the number of spaces for my word equal to the length so there is no repeated letters at the end.</td>
