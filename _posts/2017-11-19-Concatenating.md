    <td>Mr Keen began by going through what we did last lesson and telling us what the finished product will be. Then he told us how to measure the length of a box, concatenate words from multiple boxes and then put each letter into boxes. I went very fast and so had to wait before finishing learning how to do it. I found that trying different things and experimenting helped the most.</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that I finished the first task very fast so I wasn't doing anything for a while. I donâ€™t think that I need to work on any habits.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will work on his comments on how to figure things out and concatenating. I will improve my learning by asking more questions and asking for extension work if I finish.</td>
