    <td>Today we used python to ask questions and statements that react to the answers that are given. We were very free to create whatever questions we wanted and were given tips along the way for certain types of questions we may want to ask. I found that trying different types of questions helped me work and made my work more interesting.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that it was hard to get the code to only except numbers between certain numbers and would except words and mistakes. I need to try to create more diverse and interesting questions using different coding styles and add more change depending on your answers.</td>

    <td>I will create different types of questions and try and work out what would make my work on python quicker. I could improve my learning by looking at other peoples code and see how they dealt with certain problems.</td>
