    <td>There wasn't anything to learn this lesson as we were just writing down and adding up things that would have to be paid for if we owned the businesses. I found that getting ideas from other people was very useful.</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that it was a cover lesson so we were taught nothing. From this lesson there was nothing that I have to work on.</td>
