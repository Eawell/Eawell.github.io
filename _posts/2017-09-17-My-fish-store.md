    <td>I learnt how vlookups work and how to use information on two sheets together. I found that going through each part separately if there was a problem was the best cause of action as I am very new to this.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that I had my table in a different place to Mr Keen's and so I had to change some code. I think that I need to work on memorizing what each part of the vlookup does.</td>

    <td>I will try to remember each bit of code and get better at making it look good. I will improve my learning by trying out new things.</td>
