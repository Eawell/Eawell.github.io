    <td>Today we started the lesson by listening to our teacher, he explained how to create 3D letters and different looks for them. Then we went to our seats and went on to repl. I created the code to make the 2D letters 'L' and ‘I’ and defined them to ‘L’ and ‘I’. This meant that if I typed I() it would use the code to create an ‘I’. </td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that I had to leave the lesson early and so I didn’t have time to finish the rest of the letters in 2D ready to be made 3D.</td>

    <td>I will ask for the angles and lengths for harder letters from people who have already done them and I will improve my learning by working out why certain angles work</td>
