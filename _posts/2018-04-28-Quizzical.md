    <td>Today we used python to create a quiz which asks you to enter a number that correlates to the thing that you prefer for each question. Then it combines your score and find the average to tell you something about you such as how interesting you are or who you will marry. I found that thinking about what you wanted to happen at the end helped me code it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that lots of the code couldn't be shortened and had to be written separately and complexly. I think that I need to work on creating a better formulae for each question so that it is easier to create each new questions.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>I will think about what I want to do for longer before I code so that I maximise my time and do the work faster. I will  improve my learning by searching up code that can improve my work and make it more efficient.</td>
