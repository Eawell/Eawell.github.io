  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by listening to mr keen and copying what he did but changing parts so that they suited my form. The strategies that were effective were thinking about it as if I ran a real business and try to stretch myself.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that I was ahead of most people and had already started the drop down tabs and so was finished early and didn't do much for most of the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and give myself extensions and try to make my work the best it can be. I will improve my learning by exploring different types of table not just the normal.</td>
