    <td>Today we started a new period of coding with a new teacher. We logged on to a website called repl.it and then learnt about how to use it. We used Python and turtle and had to create shapes. I created a triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon and circle by using turtle to draw them. I found that talking with the people around me helped me learn and do the work quicker.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that I knew what needed to be done but writing it in took a long time. I need to find shortcuts to the coding so I can do the work quicker.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will ask for advice and try and work out what would make my work on python quicker. I could improve my learning by looking at the code I wrote and work out which part makes something happen and why.</td>
