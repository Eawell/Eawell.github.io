    <td>Mr Keen began by going through some peoples blogs telling them how to improve and giving us our marks. Then we started a new spreadsheet and copied what he had on the board. He didn't tell how to do the vlookups so we had to try and work it out. I found that working with other people was the quickest and most effective way to finish the work.</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that after I finished the easy part of the sheet the next part was something that we had never done before so I didnâ€™t know what to do, because of this for the last 5 minutes I just helped other people.</td>
