    <td>I learnt by following the instructions and doing what they wanted me to do for most of it, but further on I used the knowledge from the last lesson to help me. I found going through each step on by one helped me progress.</td>

    <td>The things that limited my learning were that I was tired and very bruised from Rugby and my computer was slow. I need to work on taking less time helping other people.</td>

    <td>I will try to point my neighbors the right way better and faster like last week and I will improve my learning by doing the quizzes.</td>
