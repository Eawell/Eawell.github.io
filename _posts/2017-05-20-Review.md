  <tr>
    <td>First we continued doing our Programming but 20 minutes through we looked at people's blogs and discussed what was wrong with them. We compared great ones with terrible ones. I think that I found the better ones more helpful as it showed me what things I should be doing rather than what things I have already done. Also it gave me design ideas. </td>

    <td>I think that the only two things that limited my learning were the fact he didn't say much about what was good for some and focused on the bad things.</td>

    <td>I will write down things that were important so I can remember them for longer. Also I ask for help from other classmates.</td>
