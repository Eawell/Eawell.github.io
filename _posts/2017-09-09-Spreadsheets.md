    <td>I learnt by listening to Mr Keen and tested things out in google sheets just to see if it would be useful. I found that this was very helpful and that if I make a mistake that seeing what was wrong was better than just deleting it all.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited at the beginning of the lesson as my computer's brightness had been put up full so I couldn't see the display properly until I fixed it and also I got confused by what we were meant to do so had to ask around. I need to work on remembering what the teacher said.</td>

    <td>I will try and listen better and will improve my learning by using the most complex methods rather than just going with the easy way.</td>
