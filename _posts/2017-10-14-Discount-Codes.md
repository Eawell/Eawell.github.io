    <td>We were told to create a vlookup to read a code and see if it matched with another one, if so show it's corresponding discount. I learnt by trying different things to make it work and doing parts at a time helped see what was wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that no one managed to get the right code to make it work perfectly so it was hard to learn. I need to try and search the internet for help.</td>
