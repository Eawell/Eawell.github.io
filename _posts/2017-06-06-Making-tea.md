    <td>Throughout the lesson we listened to Mr Keen about how to make tea. He showed us the basic commands and then talked about how to program a robot arm to do it. I found that concentrating on 1 thing at a time helped me learn.</td>

    <td>As lots of people asked stupid questions it delayed my learning and confused me. I need to work on asking more questions to advance my learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As this lesson was an only questioning based lesson I only think if we did this again to make more questions, but for code academy I must work on looking closely and really thinking about what each command does and means.</td>
