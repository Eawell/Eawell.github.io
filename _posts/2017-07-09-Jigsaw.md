    <td>There were lots of different pieces of code that I had to use so it was like a jigsaw. This was very difficult to do but I found that doing each part separately and only thinking of one command at a time made it easier.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that I hadn't done any of the coding for a week and had forgotten some of the code. I think that I need to try and remember the code better and search up things that I donâ€™t know.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to find out what different pieces of code mean on the internet if I don't know what it is. Also I will improve my learning by drilling in to my memory what different code does and how you use it!</td>
